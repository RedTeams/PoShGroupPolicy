# PoShGroupPolicy
PowerShell module to assist with Group Policy

## What GPO does that again?
Have you ever need to update a script that you knew was configured in a group policy, but you just didn't know which 
GPO? This module helps the by parsing the group policy and returing key pieces of data for several GP extension types.

### Note
This is my first public module on GitHub and I'm eager to learn. Feel free to submit suggestions and especially any
corrections.
