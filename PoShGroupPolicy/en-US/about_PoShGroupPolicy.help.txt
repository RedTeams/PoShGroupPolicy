    PoShGroupPolicy

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PoShGroupPolicy is a PowerShell module for working with Active Directory Group Policy.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Have you ever needed to update a script that you knew was configured in a group policy, but you just didn't know
    which GPO?

    This module helps the by parsing the group policy and returing key pieces of data for several GP extension types.
